## Scope & Goals of Analysis

COOP Careers is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping recent graduates overcome underemployment. The 16-week fellowship culminates in a Data Analytics Capstone, in which fellows deliver data-driven business recommendations to stakeholders and representatives from marketing agencies such as RPA. The dataset analyzed contains synthetic data from 700+ ad campaigns across the US that were launced in 2024. Various branding and performance metrics were calculated using the available data on expenses, impressions, clicks, etc. This report focuses on insights I generated as an Audience Analyst responsible for identifying top performing segments and generating audience personas. Additionally, these insights are presented alognside findings from the Creative Analyst I collaborated with. 


The **main objectives** of this analysis are to:
1. Benchmark Top Performing Audience Segments
2. Generate Audience Personas to inform marketing strategies
3. Optimize creative sizing and messaging for future campaigns

## Dataset & Overview of Data Structure

The dataset used for this analysis comprised over 20 fields capturing both categorical audience attributes and quantitative performance metrics across digital ad campaigns. Each row represents a unique media delivery instance tied to an audience segment and creative variation. Audience segmentation was defined across multiple hierarchical levels, from broad interest categories (e.g., Finance, Arts & Entertainment) to specific subcategories (e.g., Credit & Lending, Events & Listings), allowing for granular analysis of behavioral and contextual targeting.

The dataset was cleaned and standardized using Power Query to ensure reliable aggregations and accurate comparisons across segment types, devices, and creative strategies. This structured foundation enabled advanced filtering, pivot analysis, and dashboard visualizations to surface insights on high-performing audience groups and media strategies.

Conflict was also measured at the end of the year, so trends depict a one year period. Conflict also decreases overtime but students on average were already at the low end of conflict across schools, as this measure is on a 1-5 scale. 

EDA revealed that conflict with teacher was moderately correlated (-0.47 & -0.61) with students' ATL scores. Both Kindergarten and First grade models confirm this finding, revealing that students experiencing more conflict were **63%–73% less likely** to receive a ‘High’ ATL rating. Confidence intervals for both of the estimates indicate that the true population value would also reflect a decreased likelihood of receiving a "High" ATL rating.

#### Attentional Focus is a key behavioral driver of ATL — and its influence remains strong over time.

Conflict was also measured at the end of the year, so trends depict a one year period. Conflict also decreases overtime but students on average were already at the low end of conflict across schools, as this measure is on a 1-5 scale. 

EDA revealed that conflict with teacher was moderately correlated (-0.47 & -0.61) with students' ATL scores. Both Kindergarten and First grade models confirm this finding, revealing that students experiencing more conflict were **63%–73% less likely** to receive a ‘High’ ATL rating. Confidence intervals for both of the estimates indicate that the true population value would also reflect a decreased likelihood of receiving a "High" ATL rating.

#### Attentional Focus is a key behavioral driver of ATL — and its influence remains strong over time.

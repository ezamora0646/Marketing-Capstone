Conflict was also measured at the end of the year, so trends depict a one year period. Conflict also decreases overtime but students on average were already at the low end of conflict across schools, as this measure is on a 1-5 scale. 

EDA revealed that conflict with teacher was moderately correlated (-0.47 & -0.61) with students' ATL scores. Both Kindergarten and First grade models confirm this finding, revealing that students experiencing more conflict were **63%–73% less likely** to receive a ‘High’ ATL rating. Confidence intervals for both of the estimates indicate that the true population value would also reflect a decreased likelihood of receiving a "High" ATL rating.

#### Attentional Focus is a key behavioral driver of ATL — and its influence remains strong over time.

## Recommendations
**Strategic takeaway:** 

**Students with strong teacher relationships in kindergarten are nearly 3x more likely to receive high ATL ratings.**
**Implication:** Building trust early boosts academic confidence and readiness.

**Recommendations** for Program Designers & District Leaders:
1. Invest in relationship-building practices during kindergarten (e.g., smaller class sizes, SEL programs).
2. Emphasize early-year rapport-building in professional development for teachers, given its outsized impact on learning behaviors.

**Students with higher teacher conflict are significantly less likely to receive high ATL ratings — consistently across two years.**
**Implication:** Ongoing conflict may suppress student achievement.

**Recommendations** for District Leaders & Platform Designers:
1. Implement early conflict detection tools (e.g., teacher pulse surveys, behavior tagging).
2. Offer targeted coaching or restorative practices where teacher–student conflict is identified.

**Attentional Focus has the strongest predictive link to ATL across time points.**
**Implication:** Attention skills can signal early academic risk or achievement potential.

**Recommendations** for District Leaders & EdTech Vendors:
1. Use Attentional Focus as a key screener for academic risk in early childhood.
2. Build tools and curricula that target self-regulation and focus (e.g., gamified SEL apps, classroom sensory routines).
